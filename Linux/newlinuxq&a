23. Explain the difference between grep and egrep
	
	The egrep command is a shortcut for the grep binary, but with one exception: when grep is invoked as egrep, the grep binary activates its internal logic to run as if it were called as grep -E.

	The difference is that -E option enables usage of extended regexp patterns. This allows use of meta-symbols such as +, ? or |.
	
	So, for example, you want to list files in a directory and see only those which contain "mp4" or "avi" as filename extensions. With egrep you will do:

		ls | egrep "mp4|avi"
